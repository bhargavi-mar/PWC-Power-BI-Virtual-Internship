During this internship, I engaged in various tasks that honed my skills in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.

## Task 1: Call Centre Analysis
As part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program, I created a "Call Center Analysis" Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard analyzes call records from a customer service center, providing insights into topics, agent performance, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction.
